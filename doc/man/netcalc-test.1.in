.SH NAME
netcalc-test - evaluate two addresses

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBnetcalc\fR test [OPTIONS] <address> <operator> <address>
.sp
\fBnetcalc-test\fR [OPTIONS] <address> <operator> <address>
.sp
\fBnetcalctest\fR [OPTIONS] <address> <operator> <address>
.sp
\fBnetest\fR [OPTIONS] <address> <operator> <address>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The netcalc test widget evaluates two addresses according to the specified
operator.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 25
\fB-4\fR, \fB--ipv4\fR
The input address uses the format for the IPv4 address family. This option can
be combined with \fB--ipv6\fR, \fB--eui48\fR, and \fB--eui64\fR.  Addresses
of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-6\fR, \fB--ipv6\fR
The input address uses the format for the IPv6 address family. This option can
be combined with \fB--ipv4\fR, \fB--eui48\fR, and \fB--eui64\fR.  Addresses
of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-C\fR \fIaf\fR, \fB--family\fR \fIaf\fR
Convert input addresses to address family \fIaf\fR. Where \fIaf\fR
may be ipv4, ipv6, eui48, or eui64.  The prefix \fI::ffff:0:0\fR will be
used when converting from IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses.  The prefix
\fIfe80::\fR will be used when converting from EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses to
IPv6 addresses.

.TP 25
\fB-E\fR, \fB--eui64\fR
The input address uses the format for the EUI-64 address family. This option
can be combined with \fB--ipv4\fR, \fB--ipv6\fR, and \fB--eui48\fR.  Addresses
of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-e\fR, \fB--eui48\fR, \fB--mac\fR
The input address uses the format for MAC addresses or EUI-48 address family.
This option can be combined with \fB--ipv4\fR, \fB--ipv6\fR, and
\fB--eui64\fR.  Addresses of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print usage information and exit

.TP 25
\fB-p\fR \fInet\fR, \fB--prefix\fR \fInet\fR
Similar to the \fB-C\fR option, but the address family is determined by the
address \fInet\fR

When converting to an IPv6 address from an IPv4 address, the first 96 bits of
\fInet\fR will be used as the prefix for the resulting IPv6 address and the
CIDR will be set to the CIDR which is the larger of the source and \fInet\fR
addresses.

When converting to an IPv6 address from an EUI-48 address, the source address
is converted to a modified EUI-64 address and treated as an EUI-64 address.

When converting to an IPv6 address from an EUI-64 address, the first 64 bits
of \fInet\fR will be used as the prefix for the resulting IPv6 address and the
CIDR from the \fInet\fR address will be used as the CIDR of the resulting
address.

.TP 25
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR, \fB--silent\fR
Suppress warnings and excess messages

.TP 25
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print version number and exit

.TP 25
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Print additional information about the addresses and the supernet of all the
provided addresses.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example tests if the first network is contained within the
second network:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
netcalc test -- 209.193.4.7 '<<' 209.193.4.0/30; echo $?

netcalc test -- 209.193.4.7 -llt 209.193.4.0/30; echo $?

0

netcalc test -- 209.193.4.7 -llt 209.193.4.4/30; echo $?

.RE
.sp
The following example tests if the first network is the same as the second
