.SH NAME
netcalc-printf - display IP address information

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBnetcalc\fR printf [OPTIONS] <fmt> <address> [ <address> [ ... <address> ] ]
.sp
\fBnetcalc-printf\fR [OPTIONS] <fmt> <address> [ <address> [ ... <address> ] ]
.sp
\fBnetcalcprintf\fR [OPTIONS] <fmt> <address> [ <address> [ ... <address> ] ]
.sp
\fBneprintf\fR [OPTIONS] <fmt> <address> [ <address> [ ... <address> ] ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The netcalc printf widget processes one or more addresses and prints them
according to the format provided on the command line.

The \fIfmt\fR string may include format specifiers (substrings beginning
with \fI%\fR) and format specifier modifers.  A format specifier follows the
syntqx:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fI%[flags][width]specifier\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
where:
.RS 4
.PD 0
.TP 11
\fIflags\fR
is one or more specifier modiers (see \fBSPECIFIER MODIFIERS\fR).
.TP 11
\fIwidth\fR
is the minumum number of characters to be printed by the specifier.  If the
specified value is shorter than the \fIwidth\fR, the result is padded with
spaces.  The value is not truncated if it is longer than \fIwidth\fR.
.TP 11
\fIspecifier\fR
is character use to denote which value to insert into the string (see
\fBFORMAT SPECIFIERS\fR).

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 25
\fB-4\fR, \fB--ipv4\fR
The input address uses the format for the IPv4 address family. This option can
be combined with \fB--ipv6\fR, \fB--eui48\fR, and \fB--eui64\fR.  Addresses
of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-6\fR, \fB--ipv6\fR
The input address uses the format for the IPv6 address family. This option can
be combined with \fB--ipv4\fR, \fB--eui48\fR, and \fB--eui64\fR.  Addresses
of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-C\fR \fIfamily\fR
Convert input addresses to specified address \fIfamily\fR. Where \fIfamily\fR
may be ipv4, ipv6, eui48, or eui64.  The prefix \fI::ffff:0:0\fR will be
used when converting from IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses.  The prefix
\fIfe80::\fR will be used when converting from EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses to
IPv6 addresses.

.TP 25
\fB-E\fR, \fB--eui64\fR
The input address uses the format for the EUI-64 address family. This option
can be combined with \fB--ipv4\fR, \fB--ipv6\fR, and \fB--eui48\fR.  Addresses
of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-e\fR, \fB--eui48\fR, \fB--mac\fR
The input address uses the format for MAC addresses or EUI-48 address family.
This option can be combined with \fB--ipv4\fR, \fB--ipv6\fR, and
\fB--eui64\fR.  Addresses of other address families will generate an error.

.TP 25
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print usage information and exit

.TP 25
\fB-M\fR
Display IPv6 addresses as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

.TP 25
\fB-p\fR \fInet\fR, \fB--prefix\fR \fInet\fR
Similar to the \fB-C\fR option, but the address family is determined by the
address \fInet\fR

When converting to an IPv6 address from an IPv4 address, the first 96 bits of
\fInet\fR will be used as the prefix for the resulting IPv6 address and the
CIDR will be set to the CIDR which is the larger of the source and \fInet\fR
addresses.

When converting to an IPv6 address from an EUI-48 address, the source address
is converted to a modified EUI-64 address and treated as an EUI-64 address.

When converting to an IPv6 address from an EUI-64 address, the first 64 bits
of \fInet\fR will be used as the prefix for the resulting IPv6 address and the
CIDR from the \fInet\fR address will be used as the CIDR of the resulting
address.

.TP 25
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR, \fB--silent\fR
Suppress warnings and excess messages

.TP 25
\fB-S\fR
Display IPv4 and IPv6 addresses without zero suppression.  For
example the address \fI203.0.113.0\fR will be displayed as
\fI203.000.113.000\fR and the address \fI2001:db8::1\fR will be displayed as
\fI2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\fR.

.TP 25
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print version number and exit

.TP 25
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Print additional information about the addresses and the supernet of all the
provided addresses.

.TP 25
\fB-Z\fR
Display IPv6 addresses without zero compression.  For example the address
\fI2001:db8::1\fR will be displayed as \fI2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1\fR.

.TP 25
\fB--colon\fR
Display EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in blocks of two digits with colons as
delimiters. \fI00:16:3e:9b:54:54\fR is an example with an EUI-48 address and
\fI00:16:3e:71:9c:52:f0:d9\fR is an example with an EUI-64 address.  This is
the default format for EUI-48 addresses.

.TP 25
\fB--dash\fR
Display EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in blocks of two digits with dashes as
delimiters. \fI00-16-3e-9b-54-54\fR is an example with an EUI-48 address and
\fI00-16-3e-71-9c-52-f0-d9\fR is an example with an EUI-64 address.

.TP 25
\fB--colon\fR
Display EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in blocks of four digits with dots as
delimiters. \fI0016.3e9b.5454\fR is an example with an EUI-48 address and
\fI0016.3e71.9c52.f0d9\fR is an example with an EUI-64 address.  This is the
default format for EUI-64 addresses.
